Henlo there. This is a mirror for all of my projects. It looks pretty plain and
clich√© right now and so it should, cos it's a bloody template. I'll add custom
styles and stuffs soon and maybe some shitty free domain. At that point I may
as well self-host.

Below are all of the projects that I think you should see. Because this is a
dictatorship and I get to decide which projects you see and what you can't.
